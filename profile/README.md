# **Fitbit Charge 7: Is Google Discontinuing Fitbit?**

Fitbit, once a leader in the fitness tracking world, [full article here] (https://toplinetrack.com/)  is slowly fading into the background under Google's ownership. The company has already stopped making smartwatches, and now there's another sign that the Fitbit brand might be on its way out.

## **Fitbit’s Online Presence is Shrinking**

Previously, Fitbit announced on X (formerly Twitter) that its official account had been shut down, with all Fitbit-related news moving to the "Made by Google" account. This raises concerns among Fitbit fans—will the brand continue to exist as an independent entity, or is Google planning to fully absorb it into the Pixel lineup?

## **Mixed Signals on Social Media**

Interestingly, despite shutting down its X account, Fitbit's support account on X is still running. However, the UK and Ireland pages have been redirected, and the main Fitbit Facebook page is nowhere to be found.

This inconsistency leaves users questioning what's really going on behind the scenes. Is Google intentionally phasing out Fitbit branding in certain areas while keeping some aspects alive? Without a clear announcement, fans are left to piece together these changes. The uncertainty isn't helping Google's case for long-term Fitbit loyalty.
